How to test and validate your solution to the ANN assignment

There are two sets of image/label files in this archive:

training-images.txt           contains 1000 images with the digits 4, 7, 8, 9
training-labels.txt           contains the corresponding label values

validation-images.txt         contains 1000 images for validation
validation-labels.txt         contains the corresponing label values


--- Running the program ---
Run your program in the following way Note that the program you hand in must work on itchy.
Please also note that the file names may change - you must read them from the command line and then open the files.

-- Java example:--
java -cp . Numbers training-images.txt training-labels.txt validation-images.txt > result.txt

-- Python example: --
python3 numbers.py training-images.txt training-labels.txt validation-images.txt > result.txt


The symbol '>' before results.txt means that all output from your program is redirected to a file, in this case result.txt.
It is thus very important that your program only prints the resulting labels and nothing else (no debug output or similar).

--- Validation ---
To validate your solution, run the 'grading' program, which compare your results against the labels:
java -cp . MnistTest result.txt validation-labels.txt

or for Python:
python3 mnisttest.py result.txt validation-labels.txt


The program will output the percentage of correct classifications.

The source code for MnistTest.java and mnisttest.py is supplied should you want to look at it.
